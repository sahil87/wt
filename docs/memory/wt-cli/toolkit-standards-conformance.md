# wt-cli: Toolkit Standards Conformance

**Domain**: wt-cli

> Post-implementation behavior capture for the first toolkit-standards conformance audit.
> Source change: `260717-6end-toolkit-standards-conformance`.

## Overview

`wt` is part of the sahil87 open-source toolkit and, per the constitution's **Toolkit Standards** article (added v1.1.0, change `260717-nq1y`), MUST conform to the toolkit's published standards — the ones `shll standards` enumerates. This file is the audit's durable receipt: the standards version audited against, the per-standard verdict, the exact fixes and deferrals, and the trigger that requires re-auditing. It is the enforcement baseline the constitution article implicitly demands but did not itself create.

The four standards are enumerated at runtime by `shll standards`, each read with `shll standards <name>`; the list is authoritative over any snapshot. The full per-standard PASS/gap report produced by this audit lives in the change folder (`conformance-report.md`) and is embedded in the PR body — this memory file is the distilled, durable record.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The audit records the shll version it was run against

The conformance verdicts SHALL be dated to a specific `shll` release, because the standards are versioned with the shll release and re-auditing against a different version can change the verdicts.

- **Audited against**: **shll v0.0.23** (`shll version`'s shll row at apply time).
- **Standards enumerated** (runtime `shll standards`, list order): `principles`, `help-dump`, `readme-extraction`, `skill`.
- **Binary audited**: `wt` built by `just build`, version `v0.0.24-2-g97b9f0e` (stamped from `git describe`).

### Requirement: Per-standard baseline verdicts (shll v0.0.23)

Each standard SHALL carry a single verdict; each gap SHALL carry exactly one disposition — *fixed in `260717-6end`* or *deferred to `[<backlog-id>]`*.

- **`principles`** (foundation, №1–№10): PASS with two fixes and two deferrals.
  - №1 (non-interactive by default) / №4 (fail-fast actionable errors): **fixed in `260717-6end`** — the shared fallback-menu path now refuses a non-TTY EOF with a structured `Error:`/`Why:`/`Fix:` message naming the escape, replacing the bare `reading input: EOF` (see [menu-navigation-contract](/wt-cli/menu-navigation-contract.md) § Non-TTY EOF refusal).
  - №2 (stdout=data / stderr=diagnostics): PASS for the machine-contract commands (`create`, `go`, `init`, `list --json`). One gap — `wt delete`'s non-warning human copy still prints to stdout — **deferred to `[ohwb]`** (command-wide ~20-call-site realignment; `wt delete` has no stdout machine contract, so nothing programmatic breaks meanwhile).
  - №3 (help is a published contract): PASS — layered help + the hidden `wt help-dump` JSON tree (see [help-dump-contract](/wt-cli/help-dump-contract.md)).
  - №5 (visible mutation boundaries): read/write is clear from names and `wt delete` requires consent, but no destructive path supports `--dry-run` — **deferred to `[p5m9]`** (a new flag + preview code path sharing the live path is restructuring-sized).
  - №6 (stateless / retry-safe): PASS — state re-derived from git each run; `wt create` rollback converges after partial failure.
  - №7 (compose, don't reinvent): PASS — shells out to `git` / `brew`; `wt list --json` is `hop`'s composition surface; `wt update` probes the callee's advertised flag.
  - №8 (graceful degradation): PASS — missing apps omitted not fatal, `NO_COLOR`-gated color, ASCII box-drawing fallback, non-fab `fab sync` skips cleanly.
  - №9 (bounded, high-signal output): PASS — `wt list --status` caps its worker pool; `wt delete`'s unpushed-commit preview is capped; no unbounded surface (no `--quiet` is required — the clause is conditional).
  - №10 (agent-discoverable docs, SHOULD): PASS for the implemented halves (README + docs/site per `readme-extraction`); the `wt skill` half is not-yet-adopted (deferred, see `skill`). №10 is a SHOULD and the skill standard's Adoption note says a tool without `skill` is "not yet in violation."
- **`help-dump`** (binary, mechanical contract): **PASS**, checklist executed verbatim. Exit 0, valid JSON to stdout only, empty stderr; envelope exactly `{root, schema_version, tool, version}` with no `captured_at`; `completion` / `help` / hidden nodes (incl. `help-dump` itself) absent; 8 visible subcommands (`create, delete, go, init, list, open, shell-init, update`); `version` = built binary. Pinned by `TestHelpDump_EmitsValidEnvelope`. No fix required. Re-verified after this change — the command tree is unchanged, so the dump is byte-stable.
- **`readme-extraction`** (repo, mechanical contract): one gap **fixed in `260717-6end`**, rest PASS. The command-reference link in `README.md` was `https://shll.ai/tools/wt/commands/`; rule 8 specifies `https://shll.ai/<tool>/commands/` = `https://shll.ai/wt/commands/`. Fixed. The grep checklist (top-order, tail rule, image absoluteness, docs/site closure, reserved names, no mermaid, no `#gh-*`) re-ran clean afterward — the URL was the only change.
- **`skill`** (binary+repo): **deferred, not yet adopted** — **tracked as `[v7xy]`**. `wt` has no `skill` subcommand (`wt skill` → `unknown command`) and no canonical `docs/site/skill.md`. Per the standard's own Adoption section ("No tool ships `skill` today"; phased per-repo rollout, no seven-repo flag-day), this is not a current violation.

### Requirement: The re-audit trigger

Any change touching the **CLI surface, help output, `README.md`, or `docs/site/`** SHALL be re-checked against the standards governing that surface **before** it lands — the constitution's Toolkit Standards article is a standing obligation, not a one-time audit. Mechanical contracts (`help-dump`, `readme-extraction`) have verbatim "Verifying conformance" checklists; the ten principles are assessed against actual per-command behavior. Standards added or revised upstream (sahil87/shll `docs/site/standards/`, rendered on https://shll.ai) bind this repo without a constitution amendment, so the enumeration MUST be re-run (`shll standards`) rather than read from this file — this baseline records what was true at shll v0.0.23, not a frozen contract.

## Design Decisions

### Runtime enumeration over a memorized standard list
**Decision**: The audit enumerates standards at apply time via `shll standards` + `shll standards <name>`, treating the runtime list as authoritative over any intake-time snapshot; if `shll standards` fails, run `shll update` once, else STOP — never audit from memory or the website.
**Why**: Standards are versioned with the shll release, so auditing from a stale snapshot could verify against the wrong version; the constitution article itself prescribes runtime enumeration.
**Rejected**: Hard-coding the standard list or auditing from the shll.ai website snapshot (both risk version drift).

### Proportionate fix boundary: fix small-additive, defer restructuring
**Decision**: Fix here = flag additions on existing commands, a misrouted stream line, unactionable error wording, doc-structure edits. Defer = new subcommands, prompt-flow redesign, cross-command output redesign, new machine-format schemas — each recorded as a `fab/backlog.md` entry (4-char id) and referenced from the report.
**Why**: A conformance audit's job is to establish the baseline and close cheap gaps without destabilizing the tool; restructuring gaps deserve their own scoped change. The one in-scope principle fix (the non-TTY menu refusal) is a single-choke-point error-wording change.
**Rejected**: Fixing the `wt delete` stdout→stderr realignment and adding `--dry-run` inline (both exceed the small-additive boundary and would churn a conformance change); GitHub issues or draft changes for the deferrals (backlog.md is this repo's live deferral convention).
